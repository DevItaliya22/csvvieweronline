          <p>
            <strong>UTF-8</strong> is the default interchange encoding for
            modern stacks, but <strong>Excel on Windows</strong> historically
            preferred legacy code pages unless it detects a <strong>BOM</strong>{" "}
            (byte order mark) at the start of the file. A BOM helps Excel guess
            UTF-8; some Unix tools and strict parsers treat the BOM as an extra
            character in the first column header, so the &quot;right&quot; choice
            depends on your downstream consumer.
          </p>
          <h2>Practical rules</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For <strong>analytics and warehouses</strong>, prefer plain UTF-8
              without BOM unless your Windows stakeholders insist otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              After export, open in our viewer and spot-check headers and first
              rows for stray characters or mojibake.
            </li>
            <li>
              Document your team&apos;s standard in a short internal note so
              contractors do not flip encoding per project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When in doubt, validate the same file in two tools (browser viewer +
            target database loader) before promoting a file to production.

            Most CSV import failures are not mysterious: a field contains an
            unescaped quote, a row has an extra comma, or a row was split across
            lines without proper quoting. Browser viewers surface these issues
            as <strong>misaligned columns</strong> or obvious garbage in cells.

            </li>
            <li>
              Sort by an ID column to see duplicated or out-of-order keys from
              partial loads.
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-export from the source system with RFC 4180-style quoting if
              manual repair is too risky.

            Tabular data does not store text direction, only characters. A good

            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid visually reordering columns in exports unless consumers
              expect that order.
            </li>
            <li>
              QA mixed numerals and dates in RTL locales, separators vary by

            JSON handles nesting and arrays naturally; CSV is flat. Pipelines
            flatten nested API responses into tables, then humans open the CSV in
            a grid. Misparented flattening shows up as duplicate keys or JSON
            blobs inside cells.

            Excel and Sheets copy as <strong>TSV</strong> on many platforms.
            Pasting into a browser grid should align tab-separated columns to
            adjacent cells and optionally extend the table when the paste is
            larger than the selection.
